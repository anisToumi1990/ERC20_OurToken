# ERC20 Token Project

## **Overview**

This project showcases a custom ERC20 token implementation using Solidity and the Foundry development framework. It serves as a practical example of how to create, test, and deploy an ERC20 token while adhering to the ERC20 standard.

### Key Objectives:

- **ERC20 Implementation:** Create a fully compliant ERC20 token with essential functionalities like transfer, approval, and allowance.
- **Testing Best Practices:** Write comprehensive tests to ensure the smart contract behaves as expected under various conditions.
- **Educational Resource:** Provide a foundation for developers to learn about ERC20 tokens and smart contract development.



## **Features**

- **Minting Initial Supply:**  
The token contract initializes with a fixed supply that is minted to the deployer’s address.

- **Token Transfers:**  
Users can transfer tokens to other addresses securely.

- **Allowances:**  
Supports delegated token transfers using the `approve` and `transferFrom` methods.

- **Comprehensive Tests:**  
Includes tests for:
  - Initial supply validation.
  - Transfers and allowances.
  - Edge cases, such as insufficient balances or allowance mismanagement.


## **Project Structure**

- **Smart Contracts:**  
  - **`OurToken.sol`**: The core ERC20 token implementation.

- **Testing Suite:**  
  - Written using Foundry, featuring a robust suite of unit tests covering all major functionalities.

- **Deployment Script:**  
  - Automates contract deployment for testing and production environments.
